## Features and Functionalities

### For Customers:

  The system provides a simple registration and login process. Users can sign up using their name, email, and password, and once logged in they can browse the coffee shopâ€™s menu which is divided into clear categories such as hot drinks, cold drinks, and snacks. Each menu item includes a name, price, description, and photo to help customers make informed choices. Customers can add items to their cart and place orders online. Before confirming, they can review their cart contents and once the order is placed, they receive a confirmation. All their past orders are saved in their account, allowing them to view order history and track the status of current orders. Additionally, there is a contact or feedback form that allows customers to send messages to the shop. They simply need to provide their name, email, and message. This creates a direct line of communication between the customers and the admin, enabling the coffee shop to receive feedback or respond to inquiries.

### For Admin/Staff:

  The system includes a secure login process for staff and administrators. Once logged in, the admin panel provides access to a centralized dashboard where staff can manage the entire coffee shop ordering system. Through this dashboard, they can view, add, edit, or remove menu items. Each item is linked to a category (e.g., hot drinks, cold drinks, snacks) and includes a name, price, description, and photo. This allows staff to keep the product inventory up-to-date and accurate.

Admins can also manage product , ensuring that the menu is organized and easy to navigate for customers. When a customer places an order, the admin panel will display the order details in real time, including item list, quantity, total amount, customer info, and order status.

Staff have the ability to update order statuses (e.g., Pending, Completed), which helps streamline operations and keep customers informed about the progress of their orders. All orders are recorded in the system.

Additionally, admins can view customer reviews and feedback submitted via the contact form. This enables them to monitor customer satisfaction and respond to any concerns, ensuring quality service and continuous improvement. The system ensures that all administrative functions are performed efficiently while maintaining data accuracy and security.
